ReliefWeb ScraperWiki Collector
===============================

This collector connects to the ReliefWeb database and organizes the data in two indicators: 

- Number of Reports per Country
- Number of Disasters per Country

`Country` uses a definition from ReliefWeb called `primary country`, that is, "the single country most relevant to the entry." For more information about the ReliefWeb API and the field definitions, please check their website at: http://reliefweb.int/help/api/field-definitions
